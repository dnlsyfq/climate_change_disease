## Climate Change Burden of Disease



As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from climate change was assessed. Measuring the health effects from climate change can only be very approximate. Nevertheless, a assessment coordinated by WHO, taking into account only a subset of the possible health impacts, concluded that the modest climate change that has occurred since the 1970s was already causing over 140 000 excess deaths annually by the year 2004.
